    content: `
Estimating for rail projects starts with PDFs or CAD drawings. The fast path is to extract quantities with repeatable logic and keep outputs consistent for pricing. In this article, we explore the core steps of taking drawings and converting them into billable items with accuracy.

We’ve opened beta access for RailQuant’s AI-assisted takeoff engine.
It detects lines, hatches, and quantities from PDF drawings automatically.

If you’re part of the Sizewell or Moor Street pilot teams, you’ll see this in your dashboard.
